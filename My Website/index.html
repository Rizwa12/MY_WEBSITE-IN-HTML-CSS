        The Curonian Spit is a 98 km long, thin, curved sand-dune spit that separates the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea coast. Its southern portion lies within Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia and its northern within southwestern Lithuania. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site shared by the two countries.
    </p>
    <h3 class="geo">Geography</h3>
    <p class="second">
        The Curonian Spit stretches from the Sambian Peninsula on the south to its northern tip next to a narrow strait, across which is the port city of Klaipėda on the mainland of Lithuania. The northern 52 km long stretch of the Curonian Spit peninsula belongs to Lithuania, while the rest is part of the Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia. The width of the spit varies from a minimum of 400 m in Russia (near the village of Lesnoy) to a maximum of 3,800 m in Lithuania (just north of Nida).

   <p class="fourth"> The Curonian Spit is home to the highest moving (drifting) sand dunes in Europe. Their average height is 35 meters, but some attain a height of 60 meters. Several ecological communities are present on and near the Spit, from its outer beaches to dune ridges, wetlands, meadows, and forests. Its location on the East Atlantic Flyway means it is frequently visited by migratory waterfowl. Between 10 and 20 million birds fly over the feature during spring and fall migrations, and many pause to rest or breed there.</p>

        I am a 19-year-old student from Lithuania, Klaipeda, currently studying Digital Interaction design in Dundee, Scotland.
    I am highly passionate about User Interface design. Recently, I have started working with UI animations / (micro-) interactions. I am well aware how to create clean, appealing web and app designs having usability in the first place. 
    
    I always seek an opportunity to improve my proficiency. The factor which motivates me the most is the progress I have made throughout few designing years. I fancy challenging tasks, I enjoy creating innovative design solutions.
